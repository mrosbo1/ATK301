		<p>About me: Hello! My name is Matthew Osborne and I am a Graphic Design student at Illinois State University. I come from a small town called Fairmount and I just recently found a new passion for art. I never had an interest in doing art at a young age. I started my art career by taking one drawing class and I've been improving ever since. ~I'll probably add more later~<p>
